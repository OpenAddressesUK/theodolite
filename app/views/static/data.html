        This is the addresses-only version of the Open Addresses dataset. It includes the current list of addresses without provenance information. It is distributed as a single ZIP file, containing one ZIP file per postcode initial, containing one CSV file per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom#Postcode_area">postcode area</a>. Each row in the CSV file is one address.

        As above, but including:
        <ul>
          <li>references to the live, persistent URIs of each component of the address and of the address itself, and
          <li>provenance information.
        </ul>
        The CSV files in this distribution do not have one line per address, but one line <b>for each provenance element being described</b>. The actual address is repeated for every row. Rows referring to the same addresses can be identified as they have the same address URI (the 'url' column). <br />
        Note that the current URIs refer to the Open Addresses Alpha systems (http://<b>alpha</b>.openaddressesuk.org/). This will change when Open Addresses completes its Beta phase.
