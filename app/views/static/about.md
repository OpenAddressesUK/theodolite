Open Addresses is a platform that brings together data about the places we live, work and visit. We are creating an open address list for the UK, available for everyone.

Addresses are a vital part of the UK’s National Information Infrastructure. Open Addresses will help a whole range of organisations (academics, charities, civic technologists, public sector and private sector) to deliver better services to people.

You can help build and maintain this address list through the platform. Why not submit your address now?
