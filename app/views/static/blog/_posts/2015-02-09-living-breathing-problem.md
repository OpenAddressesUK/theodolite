*“But what difference will Open Addresses UK really make to MY life?”*

As an open data startup, we have come across hurdles when explaining what we are doing and why we are doing it to those who work outside of the open data community. 

The dataset that Open Addresses UK are building transcends this single sector. Addresses are important to all of us and the benefits that will be derived from them being openly and freely available stretch way beyond the open data community and into society at large.

We want to be able to explain the benefits to people of people who don’t necessarily speak the languages ‘[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)’  and ‘[Perl](https://www.perl.org/)' or know the difference between [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML/) and [JSON](http://json.org/). So how can Open Address data benefit everyone in society?

This is something that we are considering as we expand and clarify the original Open Addresses UK statement that “[By having accurate information about addresses, we’ll all benefit from getting more of the things we want, and less of the things we don’t](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/)”

#### New houses

One of the most interesting examples that we have found are the problems experienced by people who move into houses.

At present, it can take months to get the address for a new build home into the many computers that store address lists. This is due to the complex and linear nature of the process. The address for a new property is allocated by the local authority, a postcode is then allocated by the Royal Mail, the Royal Mail then notify their partners, who then publish new address lists, which then need loading into a whole variety of computer systems, etcetera, etcetera. 

As The Royal Mail’s own advisory board notes "[the speed of updating PAF <the Postal Address File> for newly occupied household premises which it seems to us, from a reading of the SLA with Operations, can be delayed by up to 13 weeks](http://www.pafboard.org.uk/documents/PAF(15)2%20Strategy%20for%20PAF%202014.pdf)". And that is just the step within the Royal Mail.

This can mean that some people can’t insure their new house. The insurance companies are not able to find it. There have been lots of [news reports](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24960746) about people not being able to get insurance or their insurance of choice because the "computer says 'no'"!

The actual cost, however, is far larger and more human. This issue doesn’t just affect insurance, it can stop people getting many of the things they want and need when they move into a new home. [Chris Royles](https://twitter.com/royles) has pointed us to his own struggle to get all of the computers to say ‘yes’ to his address.

#### Chris's story

Chris moved into a new house with a new postcode. After he had moved in he learnt that the Post Office’s branch finder website didn't recognise the postcode:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PostOffice">@PostOffice</a> please update your <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMail">@RoyalMail</a> PAF file on your branch finder website - my postcode has been active for well over a month!</p>&mdash; Christopher Royles (@royles) <a href="https://twitter.com/royles/status/489387742137421824">July 16, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In July he reported the issue to: Amazon, Ikea, Anglian Water and Parcelforce (part of the Royal Mail).

In August, the most concerning problem arose: he reported the problem to Government as he couldn’t register to vote. Let’s pause for a second: the computer saying no was impacting on his democratic right to vote:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GOVUK">@GOVUK</a> please update your <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMail">@RoyalMail</a> PAF file - I am unable to register to vote.</p>&mdash; Christopher Royles (@royles) <a href="https://twitter.com/royles/status/497320441087016961">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On 11 September there was good news. The Prime Minister proudly announced that the postcode Chris lived in, and had lived in for 3 months, was in the top 10 hotspots forfor use of the government’s Help to Buy Scheme:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>We’ve published postcode data for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HelptoBuy?src=hash">#HelptoBuy</a>, showing the top ten hotspots across the country: <a href="http://t.co/NgFNiGMclb">http://t.co/NgFNiGMclb</a></p>&mdash; UK Prime Minister (@Number10gov) <a href="https://twitter.com/Number10gov/status/510046727886606337">September 11, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Yet on 16 September Chris still couldn’t register to vote:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/GOVUK">@GovUK</a> Register to Vote !still! does not recognize my Postcode, which was registered in June. Please update your <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMail">@RoyalMail</a> PAF DB!</p>&mdash; Christopher Royles (@royles) <a href="https://twitter.com/royles/status/511913773280800769">September 16, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He couldn’t get an account to pay his water bill:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thameswater">@thameswater</a> please update your <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMail">@RoyalMail</a> PAF database - it is now 3 months out of date. Thanks for your help on my inquiry though.</p>&mdash; Christopher Royles (@royles) <a href="https://twitter.com/royles/status/511914212189544449">September 16, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He couldn’t even order a pizza:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dominos">@dominos</a> Please update your <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalMail">@RoyalMail</a> PAF address file, it is now 3 months out of date. You are unable to deliver to me :(</p>&mdash; Christopher Royles (@royles) <a href="https://twitter.com/royles/status/514491838405701632">September 23, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We don’t know about you, but we think that one of the things that many people do on their first day in a new house is eat some takeaway food whilst looking at a pile of unopened boxes full of kitchen equipment. Yet here Chris was 3 months later....

To some extent Chris was lucky. He knew the organisations to contact and he knew the secret password ("*PAF*") to tell people that he thought the problem was with the address file.

But we don’t think this is acceptable in the modern age, not least as it’s unnecessary, these problems can and should be fixed. We need to bring addresses into the modern day.

#### How will Open Addresses help with this?

Let’s imagine a different model from how it works today:

What if the local authority shared the address before the postcode was allocated? What if organisations could check how likely it was that an address existed and could make an informed choice based on that information? What if one of those organisations had proof of the address (say, they had successfully delivered a pizza) and could share that information so that everybody could see? 

This is what we want to make it possible and simple to achieve.

Open Addresses UK want to publish an authoritative and definitive address list. Our platform will be able to receive new addresses from many different sources in many different formats, we will calculate a confidence score, we will track provenance and we will publish all of this information as a bulk download, through APIs and as persistent URLs.

With our approach the timescale for learning of new addresses and making them available for people and organisations to use shrinks from months to days or even hours.

If we are successful then Chris could have ordered his pizza, ordered furniture for his new house, paid his water bill and registered to vote. He would have saved himself the time and effort of having to chase these organisations to get his details into the computer, to get all of the computers to say “yes”.

#### How can you help?

We think these are pretty compelling benefits but why not drop us a mail or tweet to let us know what other ones you can think of?

In the meantime do you want to help us make these benefits available to everyone? Why not [get involved](https://alpha.openaddressesuk.org/about/involved) and help us make it happen.
